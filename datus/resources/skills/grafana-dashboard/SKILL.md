# Grafana Dashboard Skill

Use this skill to create, update, or inspect dashboards in Grafana.

The data you need is already in a table inside a Grafana datasource
database — `gen_dashboard` does not move data. Your job: build panels against
that table, assemble the dashboard, validate.

## Key Differences from Superset

- Grafana charts (panels) embed SQL queries directly — no separate "dataset" concept.
- Panels belong to dashboards — `dashboard_id` is **required** for `create_chart`.
- The datasource is auto-resolved from the BI platform's `dataset_db` config.
- `update_chart` is **not supported** — delete and recreate the panel instead.

## Dashboard Creation Workflow

Follow these steps **in order**.

### Step 1: Confirm the Serving Datasource Contract

Grafana does not expose `list_bi_databases`. Use `get_bi_serving_target()` when
available to confirm the configured serving datasource, or proceed with the
configured `dataset_db.bi_database_name`; `create_chart` resolves the Grafana
datasource automatically. If the datasource cannot be resolved, bail with a
structured error. Do NOT try to auto-provision.

### Step 2: Plan Dashboard Layout Before Creating Panels

Before calling `create_dashboard` or `create_chart`, make an internal layout
plan. Do not expose a long plan to the user unless asked, but use it to decide
the panel count, panel order, row grouping, and expected size before any
dashboard or panel write calls.

The layout plan must include:

- Reading flow: KPI overview first, then trend, breakdown / ranking,
  composition, and optional detail.
- Row grouping: which panels should share a row and which panel should span a
  full row.
- Panel sizing intent: KPI cards are compact and share rows; trend and
  breakdown panels usually share rows; detail tables usually span the full row.
- Creation order: create panels in the same order users should read the
  dashboard because Grafana appends panels in creation order.

If the user provides a row-by-row layout, normalize it against these rules
before creating resources. Avoid blindly creating one row per panel when panels
can share a row.

### Step 3: Create Dashboard (`create_dashboard`)

Create the dashboard first — Grafana requires `dashboard_id` to add panels.

```python
create_dashboard(title="Dashboard Title", description="Optional description")
```

Returns `dashboard_id` — save it for Step 4.

### Step 4: Create Charts (`create_chart`)

Create panels with SQL that queries the **existing table** in the
Grafana-registered datasource.

```python
create_chart(
    chart_type="line",           # bar, line, pie, table, big_number, scatter
    title="Chart Title",
    sql="SELECT date_col AS time, value_col FROM target_table ORDER BY date_col",
    dashboard_id="<from step 2>"
)
```

**CRITICAL RULES for the `sql` parameter:**
- The SQL must query the table already present in the Grafana datasource
  database. Do NOT reference source-warehouse names — Grafana's datasource
  doesn't reach the source.
- For time series charts: alias the time column as `time` (e.g., `SELECT date_col AS time, ...`).
- For table charts: use descriptive column aliases (e.g., `SELECT date AS "Date", count AS "Count"`).
- Always include `ORDER BY` for time series data.
- The datasource is automatically resolved — do not worry about datasource configuration.

### Multiple Charts

Repeat Step 3 for each chart. All panels use the same `dashboard_id`.

Create panels in this visual order because Grafana appends panels to the
dashboard in creation order:

1. KPI overview: 3-5 `big_number` panels for headline totals, rates, averages, or sums.
2. Time trends: 1-2 `line` panels over a real time column.
3. Breakdowns / rankings: `bar` panels for top categories, statuses, teams, or owners.
4. Composition: `pie` only for fewer than 7 categories and exactly one metric.
5. Detail: one `table` panel only when users need row-level inspection.

For high-cardinality categories, write SQL that ranks or limits the result to
the top 10-15 values. Avoid one panel per column. Do not use a fixed panel
count; include the panels needed to answer distinct business questions, then
stop. Keep panel titles short and business-facing, and put units in aliases or
descriptions when useful.

If a chart needs a different data shape and the table isn't available, stop
and return a structured error listing the missing table. The caller must
prepare or refresh that data separately before retrying.

### Step 5: Finish and Let Validation Run

After creating the dashboard and panels, finish the run and return the created
IDs. `bi-validation` is a validator skill invoked automatically by
`ValidationHook.on_end`; do not call `load_skill("bi-validation")` or try to
run validator checks manually.

Publish is complete when the creation calls succeed and the dashboard / panel
identifiers are known. The framework validates reachability and wiring after
the agent run ends.

## Viewing & Querying

| Action | Tool | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| List dashboards | `list_dashboards(search="keyword")` | Filter by keyword |
| Get dashboard details | `get_dashboard(dashboard_id="...")` | Full info including panels |
| List charts in dashboard | `list_charts(dashboard_id="...")` | All panels with SQL |
| Get chart details | `get_chart(chart_id="...", dashboard_id="...")` | Full panel metadata; dashboard_id required in Grafana |
| List datasources | `list_datasets()` | Grafana datasources |

## Updating

- **Update dashboard**: `update_dashboard(dashboard_id, title="New Title", description="New desc")`
- **Update chart**: Not supported in Grafana. Delete the chart and create a new one instead.

## Deleting

**MUST confirm with user before any deletion.**

- `delete_dashboard(dashboard_id="...")`
- `delete_chart(chart_id="...")`

## Important Rules

1. **Data movement is outside scope.** If the target table doesn't exist in
   the Grafana datasource, stop and return a structured error naming the
   missing table. The caller must prepare or refresh data separately with
   `gen_job` or `scheduler` before retrying dashboard creation.
2. **Chart SQL must reference tables the Grafana datasource can see** — never
   use source-warehouse table names in `create_chart(sql=...)`.
3. **`dashboard_id` is required** for `create_chart` — create the dashboard before creating charts.
4. **Time series**: Alias the time column as `time` for Grafana to recognize it.
5. **Language**: Match the user's language (Chinese input -> Chinese output).
6. **Stat/big_number panels**: Use a single aggregation query like `SELECT COUNT(*) AS value FROM table`.
