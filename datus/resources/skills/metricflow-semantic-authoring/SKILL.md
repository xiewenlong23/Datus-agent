# MetricFlow Semantic Authoring

Author production-ready MetricFlow semantic model YAML for one or more database tables, validate it, and publish it to the Knowledge Base.

## Source inspection

- After SQL preflight, call `inspect_semantic_sources(tables=[...])` with the physical tables that need live DDL, schema, and relationship evidence. Batch all known tables when practical.
- Do not repeat `describe_table` for a table whose combined inspection succeeded. Use a separate schema call only to recover a specific table reported with `ddl_error` or `schema_error`.
- When `profile_semantic_model_evidence` is available because explicit historical/distribution profiling was requested, use it only for additional distribution and historical evidence; the combined source inspection remains the canonical physical schema snapshot for this run.

## Field classification rules

Classify each column by actual data type and analytical usage, not by display convenience alone:

- Put DECIMAL/NUMERIC/INTEGER/FLOAT/DOUBLE or equivalent fields in `measures` when they represent measured quantities, scores, rates, prices, amounts, durations, counts, or percentages and historical SQL uses them in arithmetic, range predicates, numeric ordering, or numeric aggregates such as `AVG`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `STD`, `VARIANCE`, `CORR`, or `COVAR`.
- Do not model an aggregatable numeric business value as a categorical dimension just because it is selected, displayed, filtered, sorted, or appears in a WHERE clause. A DECIMAL field used by `AVG(<field>)` should be a measure with an appropriate aggregate such as `AVG`.
- Put text/enums/labels/booleans and numeric-coded category fields in `dimensions` when their values identify groups or labels and averaging or summing the raw value has no business meaning. Explain code semantics (e.g. "status: 1=Active, 2=Inactive") in the description.
- Put primary keys, foreign keys, unique entity IDs, and opaque IDs in `identifiers`. Do not classify identifiers as measures merely because their physical storage type is integer.
- Do not define the same column/name under both `identifiers` and `dimensions`.
- If schema type and SQL usage appear to conflict, prefer concrete SQL usage plus column comments/profiler evidence, and ask only when the modeling choice is business-critical.
- Define measures only for reusable aggregations. Use `expr: "1"` for row-count measures with `agg: COUNT`. For measures, use `agg` for the aggregation type; do not add a `type` field to measure entries.

## Time dimension correctness

- Define `type: TIME` only for a physical DATE/TIME/TIMESTAMP column, or for a `sql_query` alias / SQL expression that is guaranteed to return a DATE/TIME/TIMESTAMP value.
- Do NOT mark numeric surrogate keys such as `*_date_sk`, `*_date_key`, `*_dt_key`, or integer YYYYMMDD keys as `type: TIME`. Model them as identifiers or categorical dimensions unless you explicitly convert them to a real date.
- If a fact table derives its business date by joining a calendar/date dimension, prefer a `sql_query` data source that joins the date dimension, selects the real date column with a clear alias, and uses that alias as the primary time dimension.
- When the user explicitly asks to preserve a durable result that normal semantic objects cannot represent, create or update a meaningful `sql_query` data source using the complete request SQL as evidence. Encode YAML with a literal block (`|-` when the statement has no trailing newline), never a folded `>` block.
- `agg_time_dimension` on measures must point to that real date/time dimension, not a numeric surrogate key.
- Include a primary time dimension only when a reliable DATE/TIME/TIMESTAMP column or expression exists; never force one.

## Descriptions

Populate `description` fields for ALL measures, dimensions, and identifiers by COMBINING all available information:

- Start with DDL comments and **preserve their original language — DO NOT TRANSLATE** (Chinese comments stay Chinese).
- Append compact filter/group/aggregate evidence from `inspect_semantic_sources.tables[].sql_usage`.
- Append compact observed distribution evidence from `profile_semantic_model_evidence` when available: null rate, numeric ranges and percentiles, date spans/freshness/duration, distinct counts, representative stable values, referential coverage, common filter templates, and enum/code mappings.
- Describe what a column means first, then add concise observed evidence. Avoid long SQL snippets or procedural query instructions.
- ALWAYS wrap `description` values in double quotes (`"`). Escape special characters: `"` → `\"`, `\` → `\\`.

Example:

```yaml
- name: status
  type: CATEGORICAL
  expr: status
  description: "Order status; commonly filtered with =/IN; representative values include paid/refund"
```

## Multi-table workflow

When the request covers multiple tables:

1. Submit all required physical tables in one `inspect_semantic_sources` call when practical.
2. Use its declared foreign keys first, exact request-SQL JOINs second, and low-confidence column-name hints only as fallback.
3. Generate one YAML file per table. Use the `entity` field to reference other tables in **singular form** (`customer`, not `customers`); `type: PRIMARY` for the table's primary key, `type: FOREIGN` for columns that join to other tables. Linked identifiers share the same `name` (one PRIMARY, one FOREIGN).
4. Write ALL files before validation, then validate them together.

## File paths

- Save files under `subject/semantic_models/<current_datasource>/{table_name}.yml`, relative to the filesystem sandbox root (use the exact prefix shown in the system prompt Workspace section).
- If a semantic model already exists, update it with `edit_file` instead of rewriting.

## Validate and publish

1. Call `validate_semantic(scope="semantic_model")`. If validation fails, fix the YAML with `edit_file` and validate again; repeat until it passes. Common errors:
   - PostgreSQL column case sensitivity: wrap uppercase column names in double quotes (e.g., `expr: '"SP_POP_TOTL"'`)
   - Column not found: check column names match the DDL exactly
   - Duplicate semantic element name: remove the column from either `identifiers` or `dimensions`
   - Invalid YAML syntax: check indentation and quoting
2. Only after validation succeeds, publish via `publish_semantic_model` with all generated file paths. Do not publish before validation passes; do not manually write Knowledge Base summary files.

## Document structure rules

- A semantic model file defines `data_source:` document(s). Do NOT add a top-level `metrics:` list to the same YAML document — MetricFlow requires exactly one top-level object type per YAML document. Explicit `metric:` documents belong to the metrics workflow.
- Do not rely on `create_metric: true` for persisted metrics; runtime metrics are not part of the Knowledge Base metric catalog.
- All `name` fields follow `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*[a-z0-9]$` (snake_case, no double underscores).
- Choose exactly ONE of `sql_table` (schema-qualified) or `sql_query` (databases without schema, or custom joins).
- Preserve original language everywhere (Chinese text remains Chinese) for optimal vector search.

## PostgreSQL column name case sensitivity (CRITICAL for PostgreSQL)

- PostgreSQL converts unquoted identifiers to lowercase. If a column was created with quotes (e.g., `"SP_POP_TOTL"`), it retains uppercase and MUST be quoted when queried.
- In `expr` fields, wrap uppercase column names with double quotes: wrong `expr: SP_POP_TOTL`, correct `expr: '"SP_POP_TOTL"'`.
- Check the DDL: if column names contain uppercase letters, they likely need quoting. This applies to measures, dimensions, and identifiers `expr` fields.

## Example

```yaml
data_source:
  name: my_transactions
  description: Transaction data with customer and order details
  owners:
    - data-team@company.com

  sql_table: analytics.transactions

  measures:
    - name: total_amount
      agg: SUM
      expr: transaction_amount
    - name: transaction_count
      agg: SUM
      expr: "1"
    - name: unique_customers
      agg: COUNT_DISTINCT
      expr: customer_id

  dimensions:
    - name: transaction_date
      type: TIME
      type_params:
        is_primary: true
        time_granularity: DAY
    - name: payment_method
      type: CATEGORICAL
    - name: is_refund
      type: CATEGORICAL
      expr: "CASE WHEN amount < 0 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END"
      description: "Refund status (1:Refunded, 0:Normal)" # Keep original enums in description

  identifiers:
    - name: transaction
      type: PRIMARY
      expr: transaction_id
    - name: customer
      type: FOREIGN
      expr: customer_id
    - name: order
      type: FOREIGN
      expr: order_id

  mutability:
    type: APPEND_ONLY
```
